# Credit-Card-Application-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Summary:

In the provided dataset, we focused on cases related to application fraud. This was a supervised problem, as the dataset included a column indicating whether an application was fraudulent or not. The dataset also contained various personal data fields about the applicants, such as Social Security Numbers (SSN), addresses, phone numbers, and more. In total, there were 1,000,000 records with 10 data fields.

Our initial steps involved inspecting and visualizing each of the 10 data fields, addressing any erroneous or irrelevant values. Subsequently, we generated 634 potential variables and then used a feature selection process to narrow them down to the top 30 most relevant ones. 

Finally, we applied various machine learning algorithms, including both linear and nonlinear approaches, to make predictions regarding fraudulent application records.
